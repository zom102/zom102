## About me
I design and ship practical NLP & LLM solutions: model development, optimization, deployment, and MLOps. I focus on making research reproducible and production-ready: reliable pipelines, scalable inference, and maintainable code.

- **Primary interests:** Large Language Models (LLMs), NLP, Reinforcement Learning (RL), Graph-based methods, Distributed Systems.
- **Current focus:** Productionizing LLMs, conversational AI, efficient inference, and developer-friendly tooling.
